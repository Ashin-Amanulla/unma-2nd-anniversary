# UNMA Website Revamp – Functional & Content Specification

## Project Name

**UNMA – United Navodayan Malayali Association**

## Website URL

https://unma.in/

## Purpose of Revamp

The current UNMA website primarily functions as an event website.  
This revamp aims to convert it into the **official primary website** of UNMA, while retaining events as an important section.

The website must:

- Accurately represent UNMA as a **trust / club**
- Avoid portraying UNMA as an apex, umbrella, or governing body
- Clearly communicate autonomy of individual district alumni associations
- Serve as a neutral collaboration and coordination platform

---

## Organizational Identity (Critical)

### What UNMA Is

- A **trust / club**
- Formed by Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya alumni associations of Kerala, Mahe, and Lakshadweep
- Functions as a **common platform for collaboration, coordination, and joint initiatives**
- Registered as a trust / association for administrative convenience

### What UNMA Is NOT

- NOT an apex body
- NOT an umbrella organization
- NOT a controlling or governing authority
- NOT mandatory for any alumni association

### Membership Principles

- Participation is **voluntary**
- Any alumni association may **join or exit**
- All participating associations are **equal**
- UNMA does not interfere with internal matters of any association

This distinction must be reflected consistently across the website.

## Target Audience

- Alumni members
- Well-wishers and collaborators
